		 * Locating a single element
		 * WebDriver.findElement() returns a single element based on some identifying property.
		 * It scans from the top of the HTML, and so it returns the first match if there are multiple matches.
		 * If there are no matches, it throws a NoSuchElementException.
		 * 
		 * "By" is the class containing the methods corresponding to the several properties that
		 * can be found by. In this file, we'll look at "id", "name", and "xpath". id and name 
		 * are HTML properties that are optional on many different tags. They are used when referring to 
		 * particular elements in JavaScript or server code. It's also very handy for testing if tags have
		 * unique ids or names.
		 * 
		 * WebElement is a general-purpose class representing an element on a web page.  It contains a 
		 * number of methods allowing us to interact with and check the status of said element.
		 * 
		 * Here we're finding the "yes" radio button by ID, selecting it, then finding and clicking the "Check"
		 * button.

		/*
		 * As we can see in the test page's HTML, the text that results from the Check button being clicked
		 * doesn't have an ID or name (as is often the case with simple text).
		 * The xpath is the most general purpose way of finding an element on a web page. It consists of a 
		 * complete drill-down of HTML tags to the particular tag one is looking for.  So in this case, it's
		 * telling findElement to grab the third paragraph tag inside the form tag inside the second 
		 * div tag inside the body tag inside the html tag.
		 * Fortunately, you never have to do that by hand unless someone hands you a print out of HTML.
		 * For testing purposes, it *should* be part of the specification. It can also be found very easily in
		 * the browser's inspector, as we'll see.

		 * Locating multiple elements
		 * WebDriver.findElements() is the method we use to find all of the elements on a page matching a particular
		 * property. It returns a list of WebElements, which is empty if none are found.
		 * 
		 * We can then access individual WebElements or iterate through them and work with them just as if we found
		 * them individually with findElement.
